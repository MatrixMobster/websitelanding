What is a Hacker?
Originally, the term hacker defined an individual who possessed strong programing skills and was involved in developing new ways to protect networks against attacks. These days, a hacker is more commonly known as someone that uses computing skills to break into someone’s  account or computer and compromise their private information. You’ve probably heard other terms that define such individuals like cracker, black hat, phreaker, spammer or phisher.all these terms define a person that uses his or her computing skills to steal important data.

A phisher is an individual who’s specialized in duplicating real content like emails, websites or services, in order to trick a user into providing confidential information which is called social engineering.
